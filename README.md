# Jeremy Gavrilov's Personal Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for my personal website. The site serves as an online portfolio, showcasing my experience, education, and skills in the field of software development.

## Overview

This site includes:

- **About Me:** A brief introduction and a bit about who I am and what I do.
- **Experience:** A comprehensive list of my professional experiences, detailing my roles, responsibilities, and achievements.
- **Education:** Information about my academic background in Computer Science.
- **Projects:** A showcase of some of the projects I've worked on, with links to the code on GitHub.

## Tech Stack

The website is built with:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
